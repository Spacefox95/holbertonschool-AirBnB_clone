## Description

The Web Static project serves as the foundational step in building a web application for managing AirBnB objects. This project emphasizes the design and prototyping of the user interface using HTML and CSS, without any JavaScript or dynamic content. The objective is to create a set of static web pages that mimic the layout and style of a complete web application.

Through this project, I will gain essential skills in manipulating HTML for page structure and CSS for styling. The goal is to ensure a well-structured HTML base before applying any CSS design, adhering to best practices for web development.

## Learning Objectives

- Create static web pages with a clear layout.
- Differentiate between HTML elements, attributes, and tags.
- Apply CSS styles effectively to enhance the visual presentation of web content.
- Comprehend the importance of W3C compliance for web pages.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- **web_static/**
  - Contains all static HTML files and CSS stylesheets.
  - `0-index.html`: Initial layout with inline styles.
  - `1-index.html`: Layout with styles defined in the `<head>` section.

  - **styles/**: Contains all CSS files for styling.
  - **images/**: Holds images used in the web pages.

## Conclusion

This project is a crucial step toward mastering web development fundamentals. By constructing a static web application, you will establish a solid foundation for future projects involving dynamic content and interactive features.
